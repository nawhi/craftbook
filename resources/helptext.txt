There are two commands:
1. Post a message to a user's profile
     <username> -> <message>

2. View all posts on a user's profile
     <username>
    
3. Follow another user:
     <username> follows <username>

4. View a user's 'wall', including all their posts
   and all their followers' posts:
     <username> wall

Example ('>' is the prompt for user input):
    > dan -> Nice weather today
    > dan
    Nice weather today (1 second ago)
    > dave -> Hi Dan
    > dave follows dan
    > dave wall
    dave - Hi Dan (1 second ago)
    dan - Nice weather today (5 seconds ago)
    
The application starts with no users: users are
created when they post their first message.
